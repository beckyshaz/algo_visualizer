This project is my piortfolio project based on algorithm visualizer that is musicall
Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that helps users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. It uses animations and interactive features to demonstrate how algorithms work step by step.

Features:
Real-time visualizations of sorting algorithms.
Step-by-step explanation of sorting  algorithm processes.
Easy-to-use interface with controls for adjusting visualization speed.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and animations for the interface and visualizations.
JavaScript: Logic for the sorting algorithms and user interactions.

How to Use:
Download or clone the repository:

git clone  git@github.com:beckyshaz/algo_visualizer.git 
cd algo_visualizer  
Open the index.html file in a browser.

Select an algorithm to visualize.

Use the provided controls (e.g., start) to interact with the visualizer.

Available Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
insertion Sort
Merge Sort

Future Enhancements:
Add more algorithms like Quick Sort and add even searching algorithms like linear search.
Provide detailed explanations for each algorithm.
Allow users to upload custom data for visualization.
